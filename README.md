# choo leaflet demo

Illustrates how to use [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) in the
[choo framework](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo) via
[cache-element](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/cache-element).
The [demo](http://choo-leaflet-demo.surge.sh) shows a reducer
that updates the `title` part of the state without affecting
or re-rendering the map, as well as a reducer that updates the
`coords` which causes the map to pan to a new location.

## install

npm install

## usage
